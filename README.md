# Escape the maze

Inside the `maze.js` is  2 dimensional array representing a maze

- 'X' represents a wall
- ' ' represents a path
- 'E' represents the exit out of the maze
- '@' represents the person trying to escape the maze

Fork and clone the repo to get started.

Write an algorithm that will guide the escapee to the exit.

- The escapee can move one square at a time
- Escapee cannot make diagonal moves
- Escapee cannot move through a wall
- You should produce an animation displaying the progress of the escapee at each move
- You are welcome to display progress using any method. `document.write` should work well to start with
- Once the escapee has reached the exit, output the coordinates of the path they took
- Please submit a pull request with your solution
